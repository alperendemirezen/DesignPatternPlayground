# Java Design Patterns Showcase

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of **five fundamental design patterns** using Java. It's structured to showcase how different design patterns can be used to solve real-world object-oriented problems in a modular, reusable, and scalable way.

## ðŸš€ Patterns Used

1. **Factory Pattern** â€“ For creating objects without specifying the exact class.
2. **Command Pattern** â€“ To encapsulate a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing.
3. **Composite Pattern** â€“ To treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
4. **Iterator Pattern** â€“ To access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
5. **Singleton + Facade Pattern** â€“ Singleton ensures a class has only one instance, while Facade provides a simplified interface to a complex system.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

The `TestSystemLauncher` class runs demonstrations for each pattern. You can run it from your IDE or using `javac` and `java` commands.

```bash
javac *.java
java TestSystemLauncher
